<main><h2>Peaceful Imagery</h2><img src="images/conjuring.png" alt="The Conjuring House"><br><p>üëª The Conjuring House ‚Äì Where Darkness Lingers

Deep in the quiet woods of Harrisville, Rhode Island, stands a farmhouse older than America itself. Built in 1736, its walls whisper secrets of centuries past, but not all the voices are of the living.

By day, the home looks like any other rural New England farmhouse‚Äîbut when night falls, shadows twist, floors creak with unseen footsteps, and icy drafts carry the scent of something long dead. The Perron family once lived here, tormented by spirits that turned their dreams into nightmares. They told of doors slamming on their own, whispers echoing through empty rooms, and the ghastly figure of Bathsheba Sherman, a woman accused of witchcraft, glaring at them from the dark.

Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren braved its halls, documenting the terrors that later inspired The Conjuring film. But the movie was only a glimpse‚Äîwhat lurks in this house cannot be fully captured on screen. Visitors today speak of voices calling their names, unseen hands tugging at their clothes, and eyes watching from the shadows.

Step inside, if you dare. The Conjuring House does not welcome guests‚Äîit keeps them.</p></br><br></br>

  <img src="images/annabelle.png" alt="The Conjuring House"> <br><p>Annabelle ‚Äì Evil in Disguise

Innocence is a mask, and Annabelle wears it well. With her stitched smile and button eyes, she appears as nothing more than a harmless Raggedy Ann doll. But behind the seams lurks a darkness that does not belong to this world.

Her story begins in the 1970s, when two young women welcomed her into their home. At first, it was small things‚Äîobjects misplaced, faint rustling in the night. Then came the notes written on parchment no one owned, and the scratches carved into human flesh. When a friend mocked her, Annabelle‚Äôs wrath left him bloodied and shaken.

Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren intervened, declaring the doll not haunted by a child at all, but used as a vessel by a demonic entity. They sealed her inside a glass case, marked with the chilling warning:

‚ÄúPositively Do Not Open.‚Äù

Yet even behind the glass, Annabelle whispers. Visitors who taunted her met with accidents, misfortune, even death. She does not need freedom to feed‚Äîshe only needs attention.

Annabelle waits. Watching. Smiling. Hoping someone, someday, will dare to open the case.</p></br><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x250?text=Temple" alt="Temple"></main>
